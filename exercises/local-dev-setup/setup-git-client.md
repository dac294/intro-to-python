## Version Control Utilities

A "version control" tool will help us upload and download projects to and from GitHub, and save different versions of our project code. Professionals will ultimately want to use the Git Command-line Utility (CLI) to do this. But many students think Git is harder to learn than Python, so beginners can feel free to get started with the GitHub Desktop software, which provides an easier to use graphical user interface (GUI).

### Git CLI

  + Windows users who have installed Git Bash (see "Command-line Application" section above) will have satisfied the Git installation requirement.

  + Mac users may find that a system version of Git is already installed, but we'll want to use a newer version. So all Mac users are encouraged to [install Homebrew](/notes/clis/brew.md), then [use Homebrew to install Git](/notes/clis/git.md#installation-on-mac).

After installing the Git CLI, all students should generate SSH keys and configure their account credentials. You're encouraged to review the professor's [Git configuration reference](/notes/clis/git.md#configuration) for more details.

If successful, you should be able to run the following command:

```sh
git --version
```

### GitHub Desktop

Students who want to use GitHub Desktop should first install the Git CLI (see step above), then also install [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) on Mac or Windows.

After installing, you will need to login with your GitHub account credentials. You're encouraged to review the professor's [GitHub Desktop configuration reference](/notes/devtools/github-desktop.md#configuration) for more details.
