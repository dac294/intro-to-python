# Unit 1: Python Development Tools

The goal of this unit is to become familiar with a set of development tools we'll be using to write Python code.

Notebooks offer an easier onboarding experience for beginners, and may be suitable for data science and prototyping purposes, however notebooks have limitations. Local development has a high learning curve, but opens up the broadest range of capabilities, and is essential for professional software development. See one or both of these options, as instructed for your particular course or learning goals:

  + [Part A: Google Colab Notebooks](unit-1a.md)
  + [Part B: Local Development Environment](unit-1b.md)

For notebooks, the text cells are formatted in Markdown, and for local development, a repository's "README.md" file is formatted in Markdown, so whichever route you take, it will be important to also review the:
